Main Topic: UseState Basic

- [React: useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState)
- [Geek: ReactJS useState](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs/reactjs-state/)

In React, the state refers to an object that holds information about a component's current situation. This information can change over time, typically as a result of user actions or data fetching, and when state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the updated UI.

Whenever state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the updated data. This enables you to build dynamic UIs that respond to user interactions.
