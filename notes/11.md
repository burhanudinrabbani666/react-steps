## More Thoughts About State + State Guidelines

### One Component, One State

Each Component has and manages its own state, no matter how many times we render the same component.

### UI as a function of state

declarative, revisited:

- With state, we view UI as a reflection of dat changing over time
- We describe that reflection of data using state, event handlers And JSX

### 🎯In Practical Terms...

Practical guidlines about state:

- Use a state variable for any data that the components should keep track of ("remember") over time. this is data that will change at some point. in vanilla js, that's a let variable, or an [] or {}.
- Whenever you want something inthe component to be dynamic, create piece of state related to that "thing", and update the state when the "thing" should change (aka "be dynamic").

  👉 example: A modal window can be open or closed. we create a state variable isOpen that trakcs whether is open or not. On isOpen= true we can display the window, on isOpen = false we hide it.

- if you want to change the way a component looks, or data it display, update its state. this usually happens in an event handler function.
- when Building a component, imagine its view as a reflaection of state changing over time
- For data that should not trigger component re-renders, dont use state. use reguler variable instead. This common beginner mistake.
