## What is react State

[React: useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState)
[Geek: ReactJS useState](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs/reactjs-state/)

- Data that a components **can nold over time**, necessary for information that it needs to remember throughout the app's lifecycle.
- **"Components memory"** 🧠
- **"State a Variable"/"Piece of State"**: A single variable in a components (components state)
- Updating components state triggers React to **re-render the components**

State allows Developers to:

1. Update the components view (by re-rendering it)
2. Persist local variables between renders
